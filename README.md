## Intro
This is a project developed in Java and Angular, using a public API to feed our own backend and frontend.

In this video you can get a glance of the application!

## Back-end ‚öôÔ∏è
We developed a Spring Boot application as a REST API to store everything, including a smaller model from the Pokemon obtained from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).
Since it's a small project, we decided to create a monolithic app with only one Databse in PostgreSQL.
We included most of the tests needed to guarantee a proper working and maintenance.

Finally, we deployed the result on Heroku.
<br>

## Front-end ‚ú®
We developed an Angular app that show three different sections: 
* **Pokedex**: Where you can browse all the existing Pokemon (+1000) and a *responsive autocomplete search* field that allows you to find one specific Pokemon incredible fast. 
* **Trainers**: Where you can see the available trainers, add new and delete existing ones. Caution! You cannot delete a trainer that has an active team.
* **Teams**: Here you can see the trainers and their Pokemons. You can add up to 7 Pokemons to each trainer. Trainers without Pokemos won't be displayed.

For all this, we've used many libraries, like animations, forms, pagination and more.
